## Bash Password Generator
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This bash script aims to solve a problem that many people have: *Using the same password for every account they create*

> [!NOTE]
> No extra technology or modules are required other than a bash terminal to run it in.

The script is easy to use; all you need to do is enter a length between 8 and 20 with the ```-l``` option and then use ```-n``` or ```-s``` if you wish to include numbers and/or symbols in your password, respectively. The script will then output a password meeting your inputted requirements to a super secret text file (*super_secret.txt*) for you to copy and store for safekeeping.
